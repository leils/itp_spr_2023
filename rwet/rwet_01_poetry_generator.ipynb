I'm interested in how cultures and experiences change across immigrant generations, and one of the spaces that this is embodied is through the recipes that we cook. Dishes change with their environments, as new ingredients become available, or preferences change, the recipe itself changes as well. Because these recipes are mostly recalled by doing (or speaking) but are rarely written down within a family, the names, the ingredients, and the instructions may change drastically. \n",
