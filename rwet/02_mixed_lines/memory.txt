Retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF) is a memory phenomenon 
where remembering causes forgetting of other information in memory. 
The phenomenon was first demonstrated in 1994, although the concept of 
RIF has been previously discussed in the context of retrieval inhibition.

RIF is demonstrated through a three-phase experiment consisting of study, 
practice of some studied material, and a final test of all studied material. 
Such experiments have also used multiple kinds of final tests including 
recall using only category cues, recall using category and word stems, 
and recognition tests. The effect has been produced using many 
different kinds of materials, can be produced in group settings, 
and is reduced in special clinical populations.
