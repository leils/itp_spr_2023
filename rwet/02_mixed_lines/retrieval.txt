Retrieval-induced distortion;
a phenomena in memory 
where a memory, sweet or sour, 
changes as you remember it. 

When you trace the line of your memories
Tug the string, pull them from the ether
lay them out on the deck 
and they mutate, stretched thin by your tugging 
smudged with your fingerprints 

I remember a day as a toddler
a wood-burning stove, warming the house
and a frozen winter beyond glass sliding doors. 
only this memory reads 
back and forth 
from a VHS tape.
