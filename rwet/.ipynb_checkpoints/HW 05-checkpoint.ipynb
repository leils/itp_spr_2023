    "> Use predictive models to generate text: either a Markov chain or a neural network, or both. How does your choice of source text affect the output? Try combining predictive text with other methods we’ve used for analyzing and generating text: use neural network-generated text to fill Tracery templates, or train a Markov model on the output of parsing parts of speech from a text, or some other combination. What works and what doesn’t? How does neural network-generated text “feel” different from Markov-generated text? How does the length of the n-gram and the unit of the n-gram affect the quality of the output?\n",
