In part I, we explore racial melancholia as a privileged psychic mechanism for evaluating histories of interminable loss, grief, and ex- clusion associated with everyday processes of immigration, assimila- tion, and racialization for Generation X in the wake of the Cold War and movements for civil rights. In part II, we explore racial dissociation as a privileged psychic mechanism for understanding the possibilities and limits of creating a healthy illusion of “me-ness” and racial self in a colorblind and diasporic age for Generation Y."
